If we have to choose, it's got to go to 1988's Mega Man 2. It refined nearly everything introduced in the original, continuing the lineage of tough-as-nails action platforming with incredible music and design. Many praised it for improving upon the intense difficulty introduced in its predecessor, and it was deemed to be more balanced in this regard.", overallRating: 2.90, image: 'https://icdn.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/mega-man-2-2-768x555.jpg', createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },

It's unequivocally the best game in the series, giving you an incredibly varied and engrossing experience, not just from a gameplay perspective, but also in terms of its story. Its strongest point is its gameplay, and Capcom didn't pull any punches when making it as over the top as possible. One of the characters has the ability to dual-wield motorcycles as weapons, which can be spun around like swords. Yeah, it's that kind of game.", overallRating: 4.60, image: 'https://icdn.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/devil-may-cry-5-2-768x432.jpg', createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date() },
